# Tree-chart
This project uses code from Shen Shuntian (https://github.com/ssthouse/tree-chart), licensed under MIT.

In this fork of ssthouse's project, some improvements have been made for better support on mobile devices, among other additional features:

- Option for the tree to start collapsed.
- Integrated functionality for zooming with the scroll wheel.
- Integrated functionality for pinch-to-zoom using two fingers on mobile devices or the web/mobile version.
- "Focus to node" function when clicking on a node, keeping the node centered in the frame.
- Option to make the root node invisible, creating the appearance of a multi-tree chart (by disabling the root node).
